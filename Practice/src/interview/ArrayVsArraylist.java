  Array is fixed length so we cannot change the length of the array where as Arraylist can be changed.
	 It is mandatory to provide array size whereas we can create instance of arraylist without specifying the size.
	 Array contains both primitives and objects whereas arraylist cannot store primitives but it contains only objects.
