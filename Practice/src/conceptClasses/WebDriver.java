   What is WebDriver?
WebDriver is a web automation framework that allows you to execute your tests against different browsers, not just Firefox, Chrome (unlike Selenium IDE).

WebDriver also enables you to use a programming language in creating your test scripts (not possible in Selenium IDE).



	Summary
WebDriver is a tool for testing web applications across different browsers using different programming languages.
You are now able to make powerful tests because WebDriver allows you to use a programming language of your choice in designing your tests.
WebDriver is faster than Selenium RC because of its simpler architecture.
WebDriver directly talks to the browser while Selenium RC needs the help of the RC Server in order to do so.
WebDriver's API is more concise than Selenium RC's.
WebDriver can support HtmlUnit while Selenium RC cannot.
The only drawbacks of WebDriver are:
It cannot readily support new browsers, but Selenium RC can.
It does not have a built-in command for automatic generation of test results.
