	Advantages of Data-Driven testing
Data-Driven offer many advantages some of them are:

Allows to test application with multiple sets of data values during Regression testing
Test data and verification data can be organized in just one file, and it is separate from the test case logic.
Base on the tool, it is possible to have the test scripts in a single repository. This makes the texts easy to understand, maintain and manage.
Actions and Functions can be reused in different tests.
Some tools generate test data automatically. This is useful when large volumes of random test data are necessary, which helps to save the time.
Data-driven testing can perform any phase of the development. A data-driven test cares are generally merged in the single process. However, it can be used in multiple test cases.
Allows developers and testers to have clear separation for the logic of their test cases/scripts from the test data.
The same test cases can be executed several times which helps to reduce test case and scripts.
Any changes in the test script do not effect the test data

Disadvantages of Data Driven testing:
Some Drawbacks of Data Driven Automation Testing method are:

Quality of the test is depended on the automation skills of the Implementing team
Data validation is a time-consuming task when testing large amount of data.
Maintenance is a big issue as large amount of coding needed for Data-Driven testing.
High-level technical skills are required. A tester may have to learn an entirely new scripting language.
There will be more documentation. Mostly related to scripts management tests infrastructure and testing results.
A text editor like Notepad is required to create and maintain data files.
